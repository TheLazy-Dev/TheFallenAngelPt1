        \nA virus called HTera spread-out
        \n and the government of every
        country tried everything to stopped, \n
        but nothing worked. \n
        Everybody was screaming out \n
        The world economy dropped \n
        and after 2 years the screams \n
        became silent and people start \n
        starting remembering how it was \n
        to live a life. But that was not the end,\n
        the virus started spreading again, it \n
        looked advanced as if it was waiting\n
        for the time to attack. \n
        That is when I started building a time machine \n
        to see where it went wrong in the future....
